20.	Note: Child class constructor has responsibility of calling parent class constructor default or Parametrized Constructor
and if child class constructor isnâ€™t calling any of default or parametrized
constructor this will throw error. Default constructor of Parent class is called
automatically by both default/Parametrized constructor of child class
but to call parametrized constructor of Parent class,
we use super keyword in all the constructors of Child class.
