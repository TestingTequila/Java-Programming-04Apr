The constructor is responsible for assigning default value to the global/class level variables
A constructors job is to assign default values to the global/class level variables
Rules for Creating the Constructors:
1. Constructor name must be same as its class name
2. Constructor must have no explicit return type

Constructor is like a special method:
    accessModifier  className()
    {

    }

    accessModifier className(parameter)
    {

    }
The moment we create object of a class, the constructor is called
