Variables: A variable is a box/jar/container which is capable of holding/storing something
Create a variable:
1- dataType variableName = Value

   Data Type:
             Primitive Data Type[8]: We know in advance how much memory will be consumed
                                   : We don't need objects to be able to use them
              -Boolean Type: boolean
              -Numeric Type
                  -integer Type: byte, short, int, long
                  -Decimal Type: float, double
                  -Character Type: char  [char value needs to be enclosed in single quotes]
                  -boolean Type: boolean value

              -> If a number could be stored in multiple data types, prefer the one with least memory consumption
                 provided that  you are not applying any mathematical operations on them
              -> byte and short data types should not used if mathematical operations is being applied on them

             Non Primitive Data Type:We do not know in advance how much memory will be consumed
                                    : We need objects to be able to use them
               -String
               -Arrays etc....
