A class contains variables and Methods
Tea:
   Sugar
   Milk Powder
   Tea Leaves
   Ginger Powder
   Water

What are methods: the reason why we create a variable, that reason itself is the method
Method: Methods are actions performed over class variables

Syntax of Method:

   AccessModifier[public, private, protected] returnType[void, dataTypes] methodName(can/t parameters)
   {
       action over class variables
   }

   Access Modifier: This defines the accessibility of variables and methods
   public: This can be accessed anywhere
   private: This cannot be accessed outside the class

   Global Variable/Class level Variables: Variables that are created outside the class
   If you want or the problem is such that all methods of the class needs the variable and also its value[common value]

   parameters: when we pass variables within the curved brackets of a method, we call them parameters
      If you do not want your variables to be shared by different methods of the class, we pass them as parameters

   local variable: when we create variables within the curly brackets{} of a method, we call them local variables
   when you always have fixed value of variable/s

   returnType except void: If you wish to use the output of a method to perform further calculation or manipulation, we should provide
                           return type instead of void.
