1. Can we create object of an interface --No
2. Can we create constructor inside an interface --No
3. Can we create constructor inside an abstract class --Yes
4. Can Abstract methods be final--No
5. Can Abstract methods be private--No
6. Can abstract methods be static -No
7. Interface can have concrete methods, provided that they are either static or have access modifier as default
8. We can create variables in interface and by default they will always be static and final
   Why variables are static, if they were not static, we need to access through object and we cannot create object of interfaces.
