1. He may not follow the traffic Rules
   -He might be caught
   -He might get into accident
   -He might get into accident and caught
   -He might pay fine
   -He might get Jailed
   -He might not be caught and reaches his destination

2. He may follow all the Rules
   -He will not be caught
   -He will not get into accident
   -He will not get into accident and caught
   -He will not pay fine
   -He will not get Jailed
   -He will not be caught and reaches his destination

   =============Programming Languages====================
   Set of rules[OOPs] for writing the codes
     -Encapsulation
        -data hiding
     -Inheritance
        -abstraction
        -interface
     -Polymorphism
        -method overriding
        -method overloading: We can have two or more methods with same name in a class, provided that,
          i) their parameter data types are different
          ii) their parameter data type order is different
          iii) their parameter count is different
          Note: return type being same or different doesn't impacts a method overloading
              : This is also known as compile time(static) polymorphism


        Data safety and security
        We will write less amount of code
        We can hide or show those codes that we want
        less use of repetition
        change code implementation
