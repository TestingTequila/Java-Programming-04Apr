Statements: Whenever we have to make some decisions, we will use statements
 if statement
 if(condition)
 {
     Code in if part will execute only if condition is true
 }
 nested if statement
 if else statement  : When we have to make single Decision
  if(condition)
  {
     Code in if part will execute only if condition is true
  }
  else
  {
     Code in else part will execute only if condition is false
  }
 multiple if with else statement: This should be avoided as this might give you incorrect results
 if else if statement: This is used whenever we have multiple options to make decisions from
   if(condition1)
   {
      Code in if part will execute only if condition is true
   }
   else if(condition2)
   {
     Code in if part will execute only if condition is true
   }
   else if(condition3)
   {
     Code in if part will execute only if condition is true
   }
   else if(conditionN)
   {
     Code in if part will execute only if condition is true
   }
   else
   {
      Code in else part will execute only if condition is false
   }
 switch statement:
    switch(over what we are switching)
    {
       case condition1:
        action
        break;
               case condition1:
                action
                break;
                       case condition1:
                        action
                        break;       case condition1:
                                      action
                                      break;
                                      default:
                                      action
